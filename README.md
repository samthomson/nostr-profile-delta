# Nostr Profile Delta

A Nostr client application that shows how your profile (kind 0) varies across different relays. It automatically checks your published relay set (kind 10002 - NIP-65) and any additional relays you specify to compare profile data differences.

Built with React 18.x, TailwindCSS 3.x, Vite, shadcn/ui, and Nostrify via MK Stacks.
